# Movie Recommendation System
This is a movie recommendation system built using Python with the help of pandas, scikit-learn, ipywidgets, and other libraries.

# Overview
The project consists of two main functionalities:

Movie Search: Users can input a movie title, and the system will search for similar movies based on the movie title provided.

Movie Recommendation: Users can input a movie title, and the system will recommend similar movies based on user ratings.

# Dependencies
Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
ipywidgets
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Install the required libraries using pip:

# Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn ipywidgets
Place your movie dataset files (movies.csv and ratings.csv) in the same directory as the Python scripts.

# Usage
Movie Search
Run the movie_search.py script.
Input a movie title in the provided text box.
The system will display a list of similar movies based on the title provided.

# Movie Recommendation
Run the movie_recommendation_system.ipynb.
Input a movie title in the provided text box.
The system will recommend similar movies based on user ratings for the provided movie title.

# Files
movie_search.py: Contains code for the movie search functionality.
movie_recommendation.py: Contains code for the movie recommendation functionality.
movies.csv: Dataset containing information about movies.
ratings.csv: Dataset containing user ratings for movies.

# Acknowledgments
The project utilizes the pandas library for data manipulation.
The scikit-learn library is used for text vectorization and similarity calculations.
The ipywidgets library is used to create interactive user interfaces.
